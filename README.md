## Problem 1

Some order of magnitude calculations for compact binary systems:

  a) estimate the maximum frequency a binary system will achieve before the components plunge for
    - black holes with m1 = m2 = 30 Msun
    - neutron stars m1 = m2 = 1.4 and radii = 12km
  b) estimate the amplitude of the strain observed at Earth for a binary black hole systems with
    - m1 = m2 = 30 Msun
    - orbital frequency at ISCO
    - luminosity distance of 200 Mpc from Earth
  c) what is the characteristic frequency of a Black Hole's normal modes? (hint, what is the light-travel time?)

## Problem 2

Compute and plot the GW signal from a Newtonian hyperbolic encounter.
